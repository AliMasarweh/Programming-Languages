# Programming-Languages

Obligatory course for junior computer science students to study functional programming and the fundamentals of interpreters of substitution, substitution cache and environment models and each of their pros & cons.

The objective of each assignment is:

1. Familiarize you with the various tools that will be used throughout the course, and to get a feeling of basic programming in Racket (pl).

2. Introduction to the course language and some of the additional class extensions (e.g. BNFs, Parsing, and Higher-Order Functions)

3. Completion of the implementation of the simple “Register Operation Expressions Language" (ROL) language.

4. A completion of the implementation of the simple "First Class ROL" (FROL) language that we have started to implement in the previous assignment – In the substitution model.
Counting free instances in the substitution model "First Class Language" (FLANG) interpreter.
A touch on the difference between the substitution model and the substitution-cache model (static vs. dynamic scoping).

5. A completion of the implementation of the simple FROL language that we have started to implement in the previous assignment – In the environment model.
Implementing with expressions as a syntactic sugar (through call and fun).
